May need to remove from config.json file to work locally(localhost):

"production": {
 "use_env_variable": "JAWSDB_URL",
 "dialect": "mysql"
}

//================================================================================

Remember to npm install, I know it's obvious...

MySQL is fucked, so make sure you go into the config.json file and change all the
database passwords to 'null' or whatever yours may be, mine is set to 1234 after a long
class of playing WTF is wrong with my sql.

//=============================================================================//

I also installed a few different packages that may or may not get used, so if we decide
it's angular and not handlebars we can strip that out, or anything other we decide
not to use.  I'm assembling this with mostly recycled code, just to have something to build from
so if anything looks unnecessary, bloated, wrong - whatever, delete, change, fix -
it won't hurt my feelings.
